glide (2002.04.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. (Closes: #189820)
  * New Upstream glide3x Source.
    - Disable FX_GLIDE_SWAPINTERVAL by default. (Closes: #118851)
  * Reverted packaging to non-native.

  * Removed emacs cruft from changelog.
  * Removed unused debian/sources file.
  * Removed dangling vim swap file.
  * debian/control:
    - Moved packages from section devel to libdevel.
    - Moved device3dfx-source from Recommends to Suggests. (Closes: #110954)
    - Improved short package description.
    - Removed legacy dummy package glide2-base.
    - Removed mention to Voodoo Banshee and Voodoo 3 from libglide2
      description. (Closes: #166350, #159373, #140355)
    - Removed build dependency on csh.
    - Corrected dependencies on debconf.
  * Removed empty debian/libglide[23]x.config files.
  * Moved .conf files to proper .config files. Don't execute them from
    postinst. Which fixes configure hanging sometimes on first
    install. (Closes: #143550, #143551, #175006)
  * Recognise "Voodoo 4 / Voodoo 5" properly. (Closes: #186133)
  * Use new debconf perl module on .config files.
  * Delegated ldconfig calls to debhelper autogenerated snippets.
  * debian/rules:
    - Cleaned.
    - Use --build-dir instead of --build when calling chores.3dfx as it was
      building the source, and when calling build.3dfx and passing build
      variables they had no effect.
    - Removed deprecated calls to dh_uncocumented.
    - Moved call to dh_installdeb after dh_makeshlibs, otherwise the
      generated shell snippets had no effect.
    - Install pass cvg test binary from glide2-bin to /usr/lib/glide2/bin/.
  * Switched to debhelper compatibility level 4.
  * Switched to po-debconf (build depend on debhelper >= 4.1.16).
  * Now using Standards-Version 3.5.10.

  * debian/patches/swlibs-nomore-csh: Script ostype converted to bash.
  * debian/patches/swlibs-001-mcpu-flag: Fixed gcc warnings on -m486 flag.
  * debian/patches/swlibs-002-automake: Allow user to supply build variables.
  * debian/patches/swlibs-003-libm: When building with noopt libm is required.
  * debian/patches/glide-fix-warnings: Fixed misc warnings.
  * debian/patches/glide2x-pregasp: Fixed missing gasp with its preprocessed
    output. Thanks to Daniel Schepler <schepler@debian.org>.
    (Closes: #143848, #165307)
  * debian/patches/glide2x-use-3dfx.mak: Include the newer 3dfx.mak instead
    of 3dfx.linux.mak.
  * debian/patches/glide2x-preprocessor: Fixed preprocessor invalid token
    errors.
  * debian/patches/glide3x-preprocessor: Likewise.
  * debian/patches/glide3x-autoconf-update:
    - Updated glide3x configure.in to autoconf 2.53 and automake 1.7.
    - Run automake with --add-missing. (Closes: #116341)
    - Give build.3dfx exec permissions.
    - Use $(CPP) instead of /lib/cpp.
    - Use proper shared object for gthread.c.
    - Include current directory for asm targets.
  * debian/patches/glide3x-comments-warnings: Fixed comment nesting warnings.
  * debian/patches/glide3x-build-multiargs: Fixed giving build.3dfx multiple
    arguments, thus allowing to pass variable assignments.
  * debian/patches/glide3x-debug-varargs: Fixed so much warnings generated
    by debug macros that caused the compilation to fail.
