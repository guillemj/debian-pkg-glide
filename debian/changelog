glide2 (2000.08.08.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now against X4.
  * Hopefully the next upload will have glide2 and glide3 merged source
    package wise.
  * No upstream source changes, mostly just a recompile, thus the
    version.

glide2 (2000.08.08) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please note that sst1 /is/ broken at this time.
  * Separate tarballs for swlibs and glide2, yes, there is a reason.
